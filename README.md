# Android CodeStyle
This is a common code style for all Sensorberg Android Projects.

When you did a change to the code style or you pulled changes from the repository you must run `install.sh`.

If you did it for the first time you must apply the Code Style to your IDE. Go to `Preferences` -> `Editor` -> `Code Style` -> `Scheme`. There you select `SensorbergCodeStyle` and apply the changes.

When you just updated the code style you must restart your IDE to get the changes applied.
